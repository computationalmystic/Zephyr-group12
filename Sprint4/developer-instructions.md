You can choose to install Zephyr SDK or install our Zephyr VM copy.
# Zephyr SDK Installation
Download the latest SDK as a self-extracting installation binary:

`wget https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/releases/download/v0.10.0/zephyr-sdk-0.10.0-setup.run`

Run the installation binary:

`cd <sdk download directory>`

`sh zephyr-sdk-0.10.0-setup.run`

Follow the installation instructions on the screen. The toolchainâ€™s default installation location is `/opt/zephyr-sdk/`, but it is recommended to install the SDK under your home directory instead.
To install the SDK in the default location, you need to run the installation binary as root.

To use the Zephyr SDK, export the following environment variables and use the target location where SDK was installed:

`export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=zephyr`

`export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=<sdk installation directory>`
# Zephyr VM Installation
