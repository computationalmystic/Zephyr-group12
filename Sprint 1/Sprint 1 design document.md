## Deployment Environment

- Describe how, with relative ease, your TA's and instructors can run  the programs you have built. If they are deployed on a server, don't worry about that, but they might not be. 
- Instructions on environment parameters we need to set and use. Look at Christian's example in slack. 
- You may decide not to deploy a database on a server, but please do describe how your system will save data to be loaded on restart. And, if you don't plan to do this, also let us know.
