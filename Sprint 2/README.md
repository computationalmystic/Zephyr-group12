## Revised ERD

## What is necessary for your whole system to work – data sources, functions, etc. The full inventory.

## Show clearly how the different software components communicate.
- Document the reasons for your decisions where you have choices in design.

## Mock up a full visual design

## Coding
- DDL
- Dummy data
- Prototype code
- Unit tests

## Testing
